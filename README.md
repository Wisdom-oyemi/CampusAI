**CampusAI**
An AI agent, built using NVIDIA Nemotron, that helps students find timely resources such as tutoring, campus events, and deadlines for clubs and assignments. 

**Overview**
Campus life generates an overwhelming amount of information—emails, learning management systems, group chats, Instagram posts, and physical flyers. Important opportunities and deadlines are often missed simply because they are scattered across too many platforms.

CampusAI was conceptualized during a hackathon by Clue, Oyemi, Stephenson, and Thomas to address this problem. The goal is to provide students with a single, intelligent point of access to campus resources that are supposedly created "just for them", but are often difficult to find when needed.

Using NVIDIA Nemotron, CampusAI can answer campus-related questions and integrate with external APIs to surface relevant events, tutoring options, and deadlines at the right time.

**Features**
- Natural-language Q&A for campus-related questions
- Centralized access to tutoring resources and academic support
- Aggregated campus events and club deadlines
- API-based event syncing (planned)
- Designed for extensibility across different campuses
